LogIQüß† is a **Streamlit-powered tool** designed for **cybersecurity analysts** to quickly analyze and query raw log files (CSV/TSV/TXT/LOG).  
It combines **rule-based detection** with **AI-powered analysis** (via Groq LLMs) to deliver **fast, schema-flexible, privacy-aware log insights**.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Upload & Preview Logs**  
  Supports CSV, TSV, TXT, and LOG formats with auto-delimiter detection.

- **Automatic Schema Detection**  
  Smart heuristics to map common fields like:
  - Timestamp  
  - User / Account  
  - IP Address  
  - Endpoint / Action  
  - Status Code  
  - Threat Labels  

- **Rule-Based Queries (Fast, Local, No AI Needed)**  
  - Top users  
  - Top IPs  
  - After-hours logins  
  - Failed/unauthorized login attempts  
  - Top endpoints  
  - Course access tracking (BNS training context)

- **AI Fallback (Groq LLMs)**  
  If no rule matches, a compact **sample of logs** (with optional PII redaction) is sent to Groq models:  
  - `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (recommended)  
  - `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (fast fallback)  

- **Privacy-Aware**  
  - Logs are processed locally first.  
  - Only compact samples + summaries are sent to AI.  
  - Optional IP and username redaction.

- **Interactive Visualizations**  
  Built with **Altair** for quick insights:
  - Bar charts (top users, IPs, endpoints)  
  - Time-series charts (failed logins, after-hours activity)  

- **Export Results**  
  Download filtered results as CSV.
